# Trace Commons Production Storage Plan

This document tracks the migration path from the file-backed Trace Commons ingest MVP to production storage. It assumes the existing `ironclaw.trace_contribution.v1` envelope remains the upload contract, while production ingest moves trust, authorization, retention, review, export, and credit accounting into durable services.

## Current State

The MVP ingestion service still serves tenant-scoped JSON files under `TRACE_COMMONS_DATA_DIR` and derives lightweight records for review, analytics, credit, and replay export. That remains appropriate for local development and controlled pilots.

TraceDAO server storage has moved out of Ironclaw. Ironclaw keeps the local
trace contribution envelope/client surfaces; the hosted DB/object-store control
plane now lives in the public `zmanian/tracedao-server` repository:

- `migrations/V1__trace_commons_schema.sql` and
  `migrations/libsql/V1__trace_commons_schema.sql`, consolidated as the server
  landing schema for the full Trace Commons relational control plane.
- `crates/tracedao-server/src/trace_corpus_storage.rs`,
  `crates/tracedao-server/src/trace_artifact_store.rs`, and server-owned
  PostgreSQL/libSQL backend implementations.
- Optional ingest-service DB dual-write behind `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_DUAL_WRITE=true`.
- Optional DB-backed tenant policy reads behind `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_TENANT_POLICY_READS=true`.
- Tenant-policy export ABAC for replay, benchmark, and ranker exports using existing allowed consent scopes and allowed uses.
- Optional fail-closed benchmark/ranker source object-ref validation behind `TRACE_COMMONS_DERIVED_EXPORT_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true`.
- Admin-token tenant policy management through `/v1/admin/tenant-policy`, with hash-chained file audit events and safe DB audit metadata for policy version, allow-list counts, and the policy projection hash.
- Admin-token config inspection through `/v1/admin/config-status`, returning only safe schema, DB cutover, object-primary, guardrail, max export item cap, submission quota, legal hold, and object-store-provider status fields with a read audit event.
- Admin-token operational inspection through `/v1/admin/operational-summary` and `ironclaw traces operational-summary`, returning only safe tenant-scoped aggregate counts for submission status/risk, review SLA pressure, DB export manifests/jobs, retention jobs, vector coverage, and delayed credit totals with a read audit event.
- Optional encrypted local artifact storage behind `TRACE_COMMONS_ARTIFACT_KEY_HEX`, with `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_STORE=local_service` selecting the service-owned local encrypted backend used for production-shaped object refs.
- Optional object-primary submit/review mode behind `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_SUBMIT_REVIEW=true`, which requires the DB/object-ref cutover guards and skips plaintext submitted/reviewed envelope body files while retaining compatibility metadata, derived records, and file audit rows. Object-primary envelope writes use unique encrypted artifact object ids per logical snapshot so review/process-evaluation writes do not overwrite ciphertext behind older submitted-envelope object refs.
- Optional object-primary replay export mode behind `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_REPLAY_EXPORT=true`, which requires DB replay selection, required replay object refs, required DB mirror writes, and the service-local encrypted object store.
- Optional object-primary benchmark/ranker export mode behind `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_DERIVED_EXPORTS=true`, which requires DB reviewer reads, required source object refs, export guardrails, required DB mirror writes, and the service-local encrypted object store before skipping plaintext benchmark artifact and ranker provenance files.
- `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_STORE=remote_service` now parses provider, bucket, KMS key, and service credential references and advertises a safe disabled remote object-store alias without accepting plaintext compatibility fallback. This is a fail-closed production configuration scaffold for the eventual service-owned remote object-store provider, not a remote object-store implementation yet.
- Optional legal-hold retention policy IDs behind `TRACE_COMMONS_LEGAL_HOLD_RETENTION_POLICIES`, preventing maintenance from newly expiring or purging matching policy classes.
- Optional DB-backed review leases behind `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REVIEWER_READS=true`, scoped by tenant and reviewer/admin principal for concurrent privacy review coordination. The reviewer/admin `POST /v1/review/leases/claim-next` and `POST /v1/review/leases/claim-batch` routes plus `ironclaw traces review-lease-claim-next` and `ironclaw traces review-lease-claim-batch` helpers select only available quarantined traces in tenant scope using review escalation/SLA ordering before persisting lease state and typed safe claim audit rows.
- Durable DB revocation-propagation item rows track tenant-scoped downstream invalidation or retry work for object refs, export manifests/items, vectors, derived artifacts, benchmark/ranker artifacts, credit settlement reversals, and physical delete receipts.
- Replay dataset, benchmark conversion, and ranker export paths persist durable access-grant and export-job lifecycle rows; already-started jobs are terminalized as `failed` if DB metadata reads, source collection, source object-ref revalidation, source-read audit mirroring, or required object-ref body reads fail before export artifacts or manifests can be published.
- Durable tenant access grant rows can store issuer-authorized principal, role, consent-scope, allowed-use, issuer/audience/subject, expiry, revocation, and safe metadata for hosted-agent multitenant permissioning. Admin routes and CLI helpers can create, list, and revoke the current tenant's grant rows while writing safe grant-update audit metadata. `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_TENANT_ACCESS_GRANTS=true` makes trace submission, contributor credit/status readback, reviewer/audit reads, review mutations, dataset/export paths, non-revocation worker mutations, maintenance, and admin ledger/observability reads fail closed unless the authenticated tenant/principal has an active exact-role grant. Signed EdDSA/Ed25519 claims must additionally match any configured grant issuer, audience, and JWT `sub` subject binding; static-token bridge grants keep exact-principal matching and ignore those signed-claim-only fields. Grant scope/use allow-lists are intersected with static or EdDSA claim allow-lists before the existing submission policy checks run; revocation/self-delete, revocation propagation, config-status, tenant-policy admin, and grant-management routes remain available for deprovisioning and recovery.
- Optional fail-closed maintenance promotion gate behind `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_RECONCILIATION_CLEAN=true`, which requires DB dual-write, rejects maintenance requests that omit `reconcile_db_mirror: true`, exposes compact `blocking_gaps`, and turns DB/file reconciliation gaps into `409 Conflict` maintenance failures.
- Caller-level tests for tenant-scoped writes, DB-backed tenant policy enforcement, review/revocation state, delayed credit events, encrypted artifact receipts, DB object-ref replay reads through the service-owned local object-store backend, fail-closed embedded-tenant validation for file-backed metadata, derived, ledger, audit, tombstone, replay manifest, export provenance, and benchmark artifact reads, service-local object-ref key-ref verification, encrypted benchmark artifact body verification, vector/benchmark/ranker payload deletion verification, privileged-action ABAC for review decisions, destructive purge, and tombstones, reasoned privileged revocation persistence across file/DB tombstones and audit rows, and the admin operational summary aggregate surface.

Production still needs stronger guarantees before broad tenant rollout:

- Relational metadata for broader workflow state, credit, audit, retention, and export manifests.
- Encrypted object storage for redacted envelope bodies and large derived artifacts. The current service-owned local backend is a migration step toward remote object stores: it records a stable object-store provider alias in `trace_object_refs`, stores ciphertext under tenant-hashed paths, verifies ciphertext hashes on read, and lets replay exports fail closed when active object refs are required. The remote-service mode is deliberately disabled until a real service-owned provider can write/read ciphertext without exposing bucket credentials to contributors or reviewers.
- A vector store for approved redacted summaries and allowed redacted trace fields.
- Tenant isolation derived from authenticated request identity, never from envelope fields.
- Idempotent revocation and retention propagation across metadata, objects, vectors, worker queues, exports, and credit.

The production migration should not replace the local queue/capture semantics. Clients should keep producing locally redacted envelopes and the service should keep re-scrubbing before acceptance.

## Storage Boundaries

Use the relational database for metadata, authorization decisions, workflow state, hashes, object references, indexes, and append-only ledgers. Do not store full trace bodies, large benchmark payloads, vector embeddings, or export blobs directly in relational rows unless the deployment is a small libSQL-only single-node pilot.

Use encrypted object storage for:

- Submitted redacted envelopes.
- Server re-scrubbed envelope versions.
- Review snapshots when reviewers need a frozen view.
- Benchmark/replay artifacts.
- Export result files and manifest payloads when they exceed comfortable row size.
- Worker intermediate artifacts that must survive restarts.

Use the vector database for:

- Embeddings generated only from approved redacted summaries or explicitly allowed redacted fields.
- Tenant-scoped vector ids linked back to submission ids and derived record ids.
- Duplicate, novelty, nearest-neighbor, and cluster metadata. Persist the final worker output in relational metadata so the vector index can be rebuilt.

Do not put bearer tokens, raw local paths, raw sidecar spans, unredacted trace text, or raw tool payloads into any production store.

## Schema Sketch

## Concrete DB Migration Slice

This first production-storage slice has now been implemented as a dark-launch bridge. It creates the relational control plane only: envelope payloads belong in encrypted artifact storage, and vector payloads can stay in a vector store or backend-specific index. The `tracedao-ingest` service in `zmanian/tracedao-server` can mirror metadata into the DB when `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_DUAL_WRITE=true`, including submission redaction counts, derived summary/tool/coverage metadata, vector-entry metadata, replay export manifest metadata, replay export source item rows, benchmark/ranker export provenance metadata, tombstones, and read/export/credit audit events. Vector indexing computes deterministic redacted-summary similarity for nearest-neighbor metadata, keeping exact canonical-summary hash matches as the strongest duplicate signal. When encrypted artifact storage is configured, vector indexing now also writes a redacted canonical-summary vector payload as a `worker_intermediate` object ref so a later embedding worker has an auditable, tenant-scoped payload handle without adding a DB column. Export audit rows now carry deterministic source-list hashes in `decision_inputs_hash` for replay datasets, benchmark conversion artifacts, and ranker training exports; file-backed audit rows also carry optional `previous_event_hash`/`event_hash` fields so pilot logs can be checked for simple append-order tampering while legacy rows remain readable, and DB audit rows mirror those chain fields when they are present on the file-backed event. Maintenance can return a verifier report with `verify_audit_chain: true`. Replay dataset exports also mirror durable tenant-scoped manifest rows with source ids, source-list hashes, per-source status/hash snapshots, and the active submitted-envelope object ref used at export time. Benchmark and ranker exports write file-backed provenance manifests by default and opportunistically mirror them into the same export manifest/item tables with source derived artifact refs plus active canonical-summary vector entry refs when vector metadata has already been indexed, while the replay manifest listing endpoint filters DB rows back to replay dataset manifests. Tenant policies now gate replay, benchmark, and ranker export requests and source selection using the same allowed-scope/allowed-use columns as ingest. `TRACE_COMMONS_DERIVED_EXPORT_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` requires DB dual-write and makes benchmark/ranker exports fail closed before artifact, provenance, or utility-credit publication when any selected source lacks an active submitted-envelope object ref that can be tenant/hash verified. `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_SUBMIT_REVIEW=true` requires DB dual-write, required DB mirror writes, DB reviewer reads, reviewer object-ref reads, and the service-local encrypted object store, then writes submitted and reviewed envelope bodies only to the object store while leaving compatibility metadata/derived/audit files in place. `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_REPLAY_EXPORT=true` requires DB dual-write, required DB mirror writes, DB replay export reads, replay object-ref-required reads, and the service-local encrypted object store, then keeps replay export body reads on active DB object refs without file fallback. `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_DERIVED_EXPORTS=true` requires DB dual-write, required DB mirror writes, DB reviewer reads, required derived source object refs, export guardrails, and the service-local encrypted object store, then skips plaintext benchmark artifact/provenance and ranker provenance files; DB manifest/items remain the purpose-filter and lifecycle-invalidation index. The maintenance endpoint can expire past-due pilot records, mirror expiration status plus artifact invalidation into the DB, invalidate benchmark/ranker provenance manifests, backfill pilot file records into the DB, index accepted canonical summaries into deterministic vector metadata rows with `index_vectors: true`, and return a file-vs-DB reconciliation report with `reconcile_db_mirror: true`. Backfill isolates per-submission, credit-event, audit-event, and replay-manifest failures, returns `db_mirror_backfill_failed` plus bounded failure details, and keeps valid records moving while DB setup/listing failures still fail fast. Reconciliation now includes submission, derived, object-ref, vector, credit-ledger, audit-event, replay/export-manifest, export-item, revocation/tombstone counts, active derived/export rows that still point at invalid sources, reader-projection parity for contributor credit, reviewer metadata, analytics, audit, and replay/export manifest surfaces, plus compact `blocking_gaps`; `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_RECONCILIATION_CLEAN=true` requires DB dual-write, rejects maintenance requests that omit `reconcile_db_mirror`, and turns those promotion-blocking gaps into `409 Conflict` maintenance failures after the normal maintenance audit event is appended. Reconciliation without a configured DB mirror returns `503 Service Unavailable`. File-backed APIs remain the default source of pilot responses. `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_CONTRIBUTOR_READS=true` can switch contributor credit, credit-event, and submission-status reads to the DB mirror after dual-write or backfill is in place. `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REVIEWER_READS=true` can switch reviewer/admin metadata reads for analytics, trace listing, quarantine queue, active-learning queue, benchmark candidate conversion, and ranker exports to the DB mirror; review decisions also prefer active DB object refs for submitted-envelope body reads, mirror a content-read audit row, append a fresh reviewed-envelope object ref after approval or rejection, and can fail closed with `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REVIEWER_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` when no active object ref exists. `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REPLAY_EXPORT_READS=true` can select replay export records from DB metadata and resolve submitted envelope bodies through active DB object refs for file or encrypted local artifact stores, with tenant/object-ref/hash verification and content-read audit mirroring that records `object_ref_id` for DB object-ref reads. Compatibility mode falls back to the file-backed envelope body if no active DB object ref exists; `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REPLAY_EXPORT_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` makes that surface fail closed. `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_AUDIT_READS=true` can serve reviewer audit reads from the DB mirror. `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_MIRROR_WRITES=true` is the write-side production cutover switch: it requires DB dual-write and makes critical mirror misses on submissions, revocations, reviews, credit, exports/provenance, and audit/content-read rows fail closed.

### Safe Migration Naming

Historical local state when this slice was first drafted:

- Local PostgreSQL migrations in this worktree end at `migrations/V23__list_workspace_files_escape_like.sql`.
- Local `src/db/libsql_migrations.rs` ends at incremental version `22`.
- The local `origin/staging` ref already contains `migrations/V24__llm_calls_created_at_index.sql` and libSQL incremental version `24`.

Current guidance after the server split:

- Ironclaw no longer lands Trace Commons relational migrations. Keep
  `migrations/V25__wasm_fuel_limit_bump.sql` as the next Ironclaw migration and
  do not add TraceDAO server tables to Ironclaw's refinery/libSQL migration
  streams.
- The TraceDAO server repo owns the storage landing schema as
  `migrations/V1__trace_commons_schema.sql` plus the matching libSQL schema
  file. Re-check the server repo's migration stream before adding future server
  storage migrations.
- Before creating any future Ironclaw migration, refresh refs with
  `git fetch origin` and re-check:
  - `git ls-tree --name-only origin/staging:migrations`
  - `git ls-tree --name-only origin/main:migrations`
  - `git show origin/staging:src/db/libsql_migrations.rs | rg '"[a-z_]+",|\\([[:space:]]*[0-9]+,'`
  - `git show origin/main:src/db/libsql_migrations.rs | rg '"[a-z_]+",|\\([[:space:]]*[0-9]+,'`
- Do not add `IF NOT EXISTS` to Ironclaw PostgreSQL migration DDL unless the
  repo's refinery policy changes. PostgreSQL migrations should be one-shot and
  checksum-stable.
- After adding a real Ironclaw PostgreSQL migration, update
  `migrations/checksums.lock` using the repo's migration checksum workflow.

```

The server-owned `V1__trace_commons_schema.sql` migration in
`zmanian/tracedao-server` includes the first PostgreSQL RLS policy layer for
the tenant-scoped Trace Commons metadata tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE trace_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY trace_submissions_tenant_isolation ON trace_submissions
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('tracedao.trace_tenant_id', true))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('tracedao.trace_tenant_id', true));
```

The migration intentionally does not use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, so table owners still bypass policies for safe migrations, backfills, and repairs while the runtime moves to transaction-local tenant context. Before production cutover, every PG-backed Trace Commons store path should set `SELECT set_config('tracedao.trace_tenant_id', $1, true)` inside the operation transaction, and worker roles should get explicit policy variants, not blanket bypass.

### Rust Store Contract Shape

The Rust storage contract now lives in
`zmanian/tracedao-server:crates/tracedao-server/src/trace_corpus_storage.rs`.
It is no longer part of Ironclaw's shared `Database` trait. The
`tracedao-ingest` service still serves file-backed responses by default, but it
can mirror submit/review/credit/revoke mutations into its configured DB for
dark-launch verification, including reasoned privileged revocation tombstones
and revoke audit rows, and uses DB-backed reviewer reads for durable review
leases. Claim-next and claim-batch stay reviewer queue ergonomics slices: they
do not broaden review decision authority, and they only claim available
quarantined tenant rows before lease/audit persistence.

The first implementation-facing shape should stay close to:

```rust
#[async_trait]

    async fn upsert_trace_submission(
        &self,

    async fn append_trace_audit_event(&self, audit_event: TraceAuditEventWrite) -> Result<(), DatabaseError>;
    async fn append_trace_credit_event(&self, credit_event: TraceCreditEventWrite) -> Result<(), DatabaseError>;
    async fn write_trace_tombstone(&self, tombstone: TraceTombstoneWrite) -> Result<(), DatabaseError>;
}
```

The concrete backend methods must take `tenant_id` as an explicit argument or as part of every write struct. Avoid generic `get_by_id` helpers for tenant-scoped trace rows.

The names below are intentionally close to the MVP concepts, but are not proposed migrations yet. All primary records carry `tenant_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` unless noted. All tenant-scoped reads must filter by `tenant_id` through row policy or an equivalent query guard.

### Tenants and Access Grants

`trace_tenants`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tenant_id` | Auth-derived tenant id. |
| `display_name` | Operator-facing label. |
| `status` | `active`, `suspended`, `retention_only`, `deleted`. |
| `data_residency_region` | Region pin for DB/object/vector placement. |
| `default_retention_policy_id` | Fallback central retention policy. |

`trace_tenant_policies`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tenant_id` | Tenant boundary and primary key. |
| `policy_version` | Operator-defined policy version applied during ingest. |
| `allowed_consent_scopes` | Consent scopes accepted for new submissions. |
| `allowed_uses` | Trace-card uses accepted for new submissions. |
| `updated_by_principal_ref` | Admin or job principal that last changed policy. |

`trace_access_grants`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `grant_id` | Stable grant id. |
| `tenant_id` | Tenant boundary. |
| `principal_ref` | Hash or external subject id from AuthN. |
| `role` | `contributor`, `reviewer`, `admin`, `export_worker`, `retention_worker`, `revocation_worker`, `vector_worker`, `benchmark_worker`, `process_eval_worker`. |
| `allowed_scopes` | Consent scopes or ABAC scope list. |
| `allowed_uses` | Debugging, evaluation, benchmark, ranking, training, analytics. |
| `expires_at` | Optional expiry for short-lived grants. |
| `revoked_at` | Revocation timestamp. |

Access grants authorize service operations. Envelope contributor fields remain attribution only.
In the current ingest service, `export_worker` is limited to replay/ranker export surfaces,
`benchmark_worker` is limited to benchmark conversion, `retention_worker` is limited to
retention/cache cleanup maintenance, `revocation_worker` is limited to the
revocation-propagation worker route, and `vector_worker` is limited to vector-index
maintenance. `process_eval_worker` is limited to writing bounded process-evaluation
metadata for accepted submissions and, when supplied with an external reference, appending
idempotent `training_utility` delayed credit for the evaluated accepted submission. These
worker roles are intentionally not treated as reviewers for generic trace listing, audit
reads, policy administration, review decisions, or unrestricted credit mutation.

### Submissions

`trace_submissions`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `submission_id` | Client-provided UUID, unique within tenant. |
| `tenant_id` | Auth-derived tenant. |
| `trace_id` | Envelope trace id. |
| `auth_principal_ref` | Authenticated principal that submitted. |
| `contributor_pseudonym` | Envelope pseudonymous contributor id, nullable. |
| `submitted_tenant_scope_ref` | Envelope tenant scope ref for analytics only. |
| `schema_version` | Envelope schema version. |

| `redaction_counts` | Safe aggregate redaction label counts; never raw Privacy Filter spans. |
| `redaction_hash` | Hash over redacted content projection. |
| `canonical_summary_hash` | Duplicate precheck key. |
| `submission_score` | Current scoring result. |
| `credit_points_pending` | Mutable pending credit estimate; do not count it as settled credit. |
| `credit_points_final` | Explicit final credit snapshot when settled. Missing values are treated as `0` for aggregate settled totals. |
| `review_assigned_to_principal_ref`, `review_assigned_at`, `review_lease_expires_at`, `review_due_at` | Optional DB-backed review lease state, scoped to the authenticated reviewer/admin principal and cleared when the trace leaves quarantine. |
| `received_at`, `reviewed_at`, `revoked_at`, `expires_at`, `purged_at` | Lifecycle timestamps. |

Indexes: `(tenant_id, submission_id) unique`, `(tenant_id, status, received_at)`, `(tenant_id, canonical_summary_hash)`, `(tenant_id, expires_at)`, `(tenant_id, contributor_pseudonym)`, `(tenant_id, status, review_lease_expires_at, received_at)`.

### Envelopes and Object References

`trace_object_refs`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `object_ref_id` | Stable object reference id. |
| `tenant_id` | Tenant boundary. |
| `submission_id` | Source submission. |
| `artifact_kind` | `submitted_envelope`, `rescrubbed_envelope`, `review_snapshot`, `benchmark_artifact`, `export_artifact`, `worker_intermediate`. |
| `object_store` | Bucket/provider alias. |
| `object_key` | Opaque key, preferably content-addressed under tenant partition. |
| `content_sha256` | Integrity hash over ciphertext or canonical plaintext projection. |
| `encryption_key_ref` | KMS key or envelope-encryption key reference. |
| `size_bytes` | Object size. |
| `compression` | Optional compression. |
| `created_by_job_id` | Producing worker/job. |
| `valid_from`, `invalidated_at`, `deleted_at` | Artifact lifecycle. |

Object keys must not reveal raw user ids, local paths, prompt content, or secrets. The service, not reviewer/user tokens, owns object-store credentials. Any backend write that stores an object reference must prove the referenced object belongs to the same `(tenant_id, submission_id)` as the row being written; bare UUID lookups are not sufficient in a multitenant corpus.

### Derived Records

`trace_derived_records`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `derived_id` | Stable derived record id. |
| `tenant_id`, `submission_id`, `trace_id` | Source linkage. |
| `status` | Mirrors source eligibility: `current`, `invalidated`, `superseded`, `revoked`, `expired`. |
| `worker_kind` | `server_rescrub`, `summary`, `duplicate_precheck`, `embedding`, `ranking`, `benchmark_conversion`, `process_evaluation`. |
| `worker_version` | Version of producing code/model/policy. |
| `input_object_ref_id` | Exact input artifact, resolved only through `(tenant_id, submission_id, object_ref_id)`. |
| `input_hash` | Hash of input projection. |
| `output_object_ref_id` | Optional large output, resolved only through `(tenant_id, submission_id, object_ref_id)`. |
| `canonical_summary` | Redacted short summary when safe for DB. |
| `canonical_summary_hash` | Hash for duplicate checks. |
| `summary_model` | Producing summarizer/model or deterministic summary policy id. |
| `task_success`, `privacy_risk`, `event_count` | Queryable attributes. |
| `tool_sequence`, `tool_categories`, `coverage_tags` | Queryable arrays or join tables. |
| `duplicate_score`, `novelty_score`, `cluster_id` | Utility metadata. |

Process-evaluation derived rows should use `worker_kind = process_evaluation`, store the
evaluator version in `worker_version`, keep label and rubric output in bounded metadata or
an optional `worker_intermediate` object ref, and expose only safe aggregate values such as
tool-selection, argument-quality, ordering, verification, side-effect-safety ratings, and
overall score. DB derived ids are versioned by evaluator version rather than overwritten, so
rerunning a new rubric version preserves the previous process-evaluation row. Process-evaluation
requests may also include a bounded utility credit delta plus external reference; the
service appends `training_utility` delayed credit idempotently and reports appended/skipped
counts without making the worker a generic credit mutator. Process-evaluation audit rows use
typed safe metadata with evaluator-version and external-reference hashes, label counts,
rating counts, score band, and optional credit delta, never raw evaluator payloads or raw
external refs. Derived coverage tags use the wire-format enum values, for example
`process_label:proper_verification`, `process_verification:pass`, and `process_eval:high`,
so analytics can aggregate process quality without reading trace bodies. DB-backed reviewer
metadata reads normalize these records into one primary duplicate-precheck row per
submission and merge process-evaluation coverage tags into that row, so
list/export/analytics paths do not double-count a trace just because a process evaluator
appended a second derived record. Consumers should require `status = current` and a
non-revoked source submission.

### Vector Index Metadata

`trace_vector_entries`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `vector_entry_id` | Stable id shared with vector DB. |
| `tenant_id`, `submission_id`, `derived_id` | Source linkage. |
| `vector_store` | Backend alias: pgvector, libSQL vector index, Qdrant, etc. |
| `embedding_model`, `embedding_dimension`, `embedding_version` | Rebuild metadata. |
| `source_projection` | `canonical_summary`, `redacted_messages`, `redacted_tool_sequence`. |
| `source_hash` | Hash of embedded redacted projection. |
| `status` | `active`, `invalidated`, `deleted`. |
| `nearest_trace_ids`, `cluster_id`, `duplicate_score`, `novelty_score` | Latest analysis snapshot. |
| `indexed_at`, `invalidated_at`, `deleted_at` | Lifecycle timestamps. |

Production may keep the vector payload in an external vector DB. Relational metadata remains the source of truth for revocation and rebuild.

### Audit Events

`trace_audit_events`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `audit_event_id` | Append-only event id. |
| `tenant_id` | Tenant boundary. |
| `actor_principal_ref` | Human, token, or worker principal. |
| `actor_role` | Role at time of action. |
| `job_id` | Optional worker job. |
| `submission_id`, `object_ref_id`, `export_manifest_id` | Optional targets. |
| `action` | Submit, read, review, credit mutate, revoke, export, retain, purge, vector index, benchmark convert, policy update. |
| `reason` | Required for privileged actions. |
| `request_id` | API request or worker trace id. |
| `decision_inputs_hash` | Hash of reviewed policy/input projection. |
| `metadata_kind`, `metadata` | Typed `TraceAuditSafeMetadata` projection only. Backends must reject arbitrary request bodies, tool payloads, raw paths, token values, and unallowlisted JSON keys. |
| `created_at` | Append timestamp. |
| `previous_event_hash`, `event_hash` | Optional tamper-evident chain per tenant. |

Audit rows should be append-only. Corrections are new events.

### Credit Ledger

`trace_credit_ledger`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `credit_event_id` | Append-only event id. |
| `tenant_id`, `submission_id`, `trace_id` | Source linkage. |
| `credit_account_ref` | Pseudonymous credit account. |
| `event_type` | Accepted, privacy rejection, duplicate rejection, benchmark conversion, regression catch, training utility, reviewer bonus, abuse penalty. |
| `points_delta` | Signed decimal. |
| `reason` | Human-readable explanation. |
| `external_ref` | Review decision, benchmark artifact, training run, or export manifest. |
| `actor_principal_ref`, `actor_role` | Mutating actor. |
| `settlement_state` | `pending`, `final`, `reversed`. |
| `created_at` | Append timestamp. |

Do not mutate historical ledger rows. Materialized credit totals can be cached separately and rebuilt.

### Export Manifests

`trace_export_manifests`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `export_manifest_id` | Export job id. |
| `tenant_id` | Tenant boundary. |
| `requested_by_principal_ref` | Requesting actor. |
| `purpose` | `replay_dataset`, `benchmark_eval`, `ranking_training`, `model_training`, `analytics`. |
| `consent_scope_filter`, `allowed_use_filter`, `review_state_filter`, `privacy_risk_filter` | Export policy inputs. |
| `status` | `planned`, `running`, `complete`, `failed`, `revoked_invalid`, `expired_invalid`. |
| `item_count` | Source trace count. |
| `manifest_object_ref_id` | Object ref for full manifest if large. |
| `result_object_ref_id` | Object ref for export payload. |
| `created_at`, `completed_at`, `invalidated_at` | Lifecycle timestamps. |

`trace_export_manifest_items`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `export_manifest_id`, `tenant_id`, `submission_id` | Source trace membership. |
| `derived_id`, `object_ref_id`, `vector_entry_id` | Exact artifact versions used. |
| `source_status_at_export`, `source_hash_at_export` | Verification snapshot. |
| `source_invalidated_at`, `source_invalidation_reason` | Set when revocation, expiration, or purge invalidates a prior export item. |

Every export item needs an audit event or an audit batch event with a cryptographic item list hash. The pilot replay, benchmark, and ranker export paths already write a deterministic source-list hash into both the exported artifact/manifest and the mirrored audit `decision_inputs_hash`; benchmark and ranker exports also persist file-backed provenance manifests, and replay dataset exports promote that hash plus item-level source snapshots into durable DB manifests.

The consolidated Trace Commons migration implements the compact `trace_export_manifests` control row for replay dataset exports in both PostgreSQL and libSQL. It stores tenant id, export manifest id, artifact kind, purpose, audit event id, source submission ids, source-list hash, item count, generation time, and invalidation/deletion timestamps. It also includes `trace_export_manifest_items` rows for each replay export source, durable `trace_retention_jobs` and `trace_retention_job_items` rows, durable review lease fields on `trace_submissions`, revocation-propagation rows, tenant-access grants, and export access grant/job rows. Replay, benchmark conversion, ranker-candidate, and ranker-pair export call sites now mirror one-shot grants and running/complete job state into these tables, with required DB mirror mode failing closed if the durable job row cannot be started or completed.

### Benchmark Artifacts

`trace_benchmark_artifacts`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `benchmark_artifact_id` | Stable artifact id. |
| `tenant_id`, `submission_id`, `derived_id` | Source linkage. |
| `benchmark_kind` | `replay`, `process_eval`, `regression_case`, `ranking_pair`. |
| `artifact_version` | Conversion schema version. |
| `object_ref_id` | Encrypted object payload. |
| `requirements_hash` | Required tools/assertions/environment. |
| `status` | `candidate`, `approved`, `published`, `invalidated`, `deleted`. |
| `created_by_job_id` | Conversion worker. |
| `published_export_manifest_id` | Optional export linkage. |
| `created_at`, `invalidated_at`, `deleted_at` | Lifecycle timestamps. |

Benchmark conversion must fail closed if the source is revoked, expired, not approved for the target use, missing replay metadata, or out of policy.

### Tombstones and Retention Jobs

`trace_tombstones`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tombstone_id` | Stable id. |
| `tenant_id`, `submission_id` | Revoked/purged submission. |
| `trace_id` | Trace id if retained by policy. |
| `redaction_hash`, `canonical_summary_hash` | Re-ingest/export prevention keys. |
| `reason` | Contributor revocation, policy expiry, admin purge, abuse. |
| `first_seen_at`, `effective_at` | Idempotency timestamps. |
| `retain_until` | Tombstone retention window. |
| `created_by_principal_ref` | Actor or worker. |

Tombstones should outlive content deletion long enough to prevent re-ingest or re-export of the same material.

`trace_retention_jobs`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tenant_id`, `retention_job_id` | Tenant-scoped job id. |
| `purpose` | Maintenance run purpose such as `retention_maintenance`. |
| `dry_run` | Whether the run only planned actions. |
| `status` | `planned`, `dry_run`, `running`, `complete`, `failed`, `paused`. |
| `requested_by_principal_ref`, `requested_by_role` | Actor or worker that requested the run. |
| `purge_expired_before`, `prune_export_cache`, `max_export_age_hours` | Selection knobs used by the maintenance run. |
| `audit_event_id` | Linked append-only maintenance audit event. |
| `action_counts` | Aggregate lifecycle/export/object/vector counts. |
| `selected_revoked_count`, `selected_expired_count` | Source selection counters. |
| `started_at`, `completed_at` | Lifecycle timestamps. |

`trace_retention_job_items`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `retention_job_id`, `tenant_id`, `submission_id` | Selected source. |
| `action` | `revoke`, `expire`, or `purge`. |
| `status` | `pending`, `done`, `failed`, `skipped`. |
| `reason` | Lifecycle reason, for example `retention_expired`. |
| `action_counts` | Per-submission object/vector/export invalidation counts. |
| `verified_at` | Post-action verification time. |

Retention jobs must be resumable and must verify that tenant, policy, consent, and revocation state still match immediately before destructive actions.

### Export Grants and Jobs

`trace_export_access_grants`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tenant_id`, `grant_id` | Tenant-scoped short-lived grant id. |
| `export_job_id` | Export job slice the grant authorizes. |
| `caller_principal_ref` | Caller or service principal receiving the grant. |
| `requested_dataset_kind` | Dataset class such as replay, benchmark, or ranker. |
| `purpose` | Bounded export purpose. |
| `max_item_cap` | Optional per-grant item cap. |
| `status` | `active`, `consumed`, `revoked`, or `expired`. |
| `requested_at`, `expires_at` | Grant validity window. |
| `metadata_json` | Safe request metadata only. |

`trace_export_jobs`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tenant_id`, `export_job_id` | Tenant-scoped export job id. |
| `grant_id` | Durable grant consumed by the job. |
| `caller_principal_ref`, `requested_dataset_kind`, `purpose` | Request projection copied from the grant for auditability. |
| `max_item_cap` | Optional bounded item cap used by the job. |
| `status` | `queued`, `running`, `complete`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `expired`. |
| `requested_at`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `expires_at` | Lifecycle and expiry timestamps. |
| `result_manifest_id` | Optional manifest produced by the job. |
| `item_count`, `last_error` | Result count or bounded failure reason. |
| `metadata_json` | Safe job metadata only. |

Export grants and jobs must stay tenant-scoped and idempotent. PostgreSQL enables RLS on both tables; libSQL enforces tenant isolation through every `TraceCorpusStore` query and targeted store tests.

## PostgreSQL and libSQL Parity Notes

PostgreSQL should be the production control plane for multi-tenant service deployments. Use native UUIDs, enums or checked text, JSONB for small metadata projections, GIN indexes for tags/scopes, row-level security for tenant isolation, and transactional migration support. If vectors stay in Postgres, use pgvector for approved redacted embeddings; otherwise keep vector metadata in Postgres and use an external vector store for payload/search.

libSQL remains useful for local development, tests, and small deployments. It can mirror the same logical schema with text UUIDs, checked text enums, JSON text, integer booleans, FTS5 where needed, and `libsql_vector_idx` only for local vector workflows. Because libSQL does not provide PostgreSQL-style row-level security, tenant isolation must be enforced by repository methods, query builders, and integration tests that prove every call site supplies `tenant_id`.

Parity rules:

- Keep table names, logical columns, status values, and state transitions identical.
- Store timestamps as timestamptz in PostgreSQL and RFC3339 UTC text in libSQL.
- Use numeric/decimal for credit in PostgreSQL; use integer minor units or text decimal in libSQL to avoid float drift in ledgers.
- Treat arrays as join tables when query correctness matters across both backends. JSON arrays are acceptable only for non-authoritative display metadata.
- Put redacted envelope bodies and large artifacts in object storage for both backends. libSQL should not become the object store except in tests.
- Keep object refs and vector metadata in DB; keep object payloads in encrypted object storage; keep vector payloads in vector DB or backend-specific vector index.
- Implement DB trait operations at the shared trait first when this becomes code, then add PostgreSQL and libSQL implementations together.

## Rollout Plan

1. Define storage contracts without changing ingest behavior.
   - Freeze status enums, object ref kinds, credit event types, audit actions, retention actions, and export purposes.
   - Add serialization fixtures that map current file-backed records to the proposed logical rows.

2. Add relational metadata behind a dark-launch flag.
   - Keep file storage as the served path.
   - Dual-write submission metadata, derived metadata, credit events, tombstones, and audit events to DB.
   - Store envelope payloads in the existing file store and write DB object refs pointing at those files during the bridge phase.

3. Add encrypted object storage.
   - On new ingest, write server re-scrubbed envelopes to object storage and record `trace_object_refs`.
   - Keep file-backed reads compatible by falling back from DB object ref to existing path layout; require active object refs with `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REVIEWER_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` for production review decisions, `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REPLAY_EXPORT_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` for production replay export reads, and `TRACE_COMMONS_DERIVED_EXPORT_REQUIRE_OBJECT_REFS=true` for production benchmark/ranker source validation. Use `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_SUBMIT_REVIEW=true` to skip plaintext submitted/reviewed envelope body files once DB/object-ref review guards and the service-local encrypted object store are configured. Use `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_PRIMARY_DERIVED_EXPORTS=true` to skip plaintext benchmark/ranker derived export files once DB reviewer reads, export guardrails, required source refs, and service-local object storage are configured.
   - Verify object integrity by hash before review/export reads.

4. Add vector worker as a derived-artifact consumer.
   - Index only accepted, unrevoked, unexpired, approved redacted projections.
   - Write `trace_vector_entries` and `trace_derived_records` after checking revocation immediately before publish.
   - Keep novelty/duplicate scores advisory until reconciliation jobs are green.

5. Switch reads to DB-first. This remains the next major storage cutover.
   - Contributor status, credit, review queues, analytics, and exports read from DB metadata.
   - Envelope body reads resolve through `trace_object_refs`.
   - File-backed records remain a compatibility fallback for pilot data.

6. Backfill existing file-backed data.
   - Scan each tenant directory, validate JSON, recompute hashes, create object refs, insert metadata, and append audit import events.
   - Quarantine records with validation mismatches rather than accepting silently.
   - Produce a per-tenant migration manifest with source file hashes and resulting row/object ids.

7. Enable production retention and revocation propagation.
   - Revocation writes tombstones first, then invalidates submissions, derived rows, vectors, benchmarks, and exports.
   - Retention jobs run in dry-run mode first and require verification reports before destructive deletes.
   - Destructive object/vector deletion is delayed behind a grace period.

8. Disable file-backed writes for production tenants.
   - Leave read compatibility for one release window.
   - Keep rollback by continuing DB/object dual-write until verification succeeds for all active tenants.

## Migration Verification

Each migration batch should verify:

- Every accepted/quarantined/rejected/revoked file record has exactly one `trace_submissions` row.
- Every submission has at least one envelope object ref or an explicit tombstone/purged state.
- DB `redaction_hash`, `canonical_summary_hash`, consent scopes, status, credit snapshot, and privacy risk match recomputed values.
- Credit ledger totals match local credit responses for each contributor principal.
- Sampled contributor credit/status/events, reviewer queues/lists, analytics summaries, audit event counts, and replay/export manifest listings match file-backed reader projections before a DB read flag is promoted.
- Object hashes match stored refs and decrypt under the expected tenant/key policy.
- Vector entries do not exist for revoked, rejected, quarantined, expired, or out-of-scope submissions.
- Audit import events cover every migrated submission and object ref.

## Operator Promotion Runbook Draft

This is a finish-line checklist for canary tenants. It documents the current branch shape; it does not mean Trace Commons is broadly production-ready.

Common preflight:

- Start with `GET /v1/admin/config-status` and confirm DB dual-write, required DB mirror writes, object-store mode, tenant rollout gates, RLS readiness, and issuer/keyset health without relying on raw tenant ids, key ids, PEMs, hosts, or credentials in logs. Then read `GET /v1/admin/operational-summary` or run `ironclaw traces operational-summary` for safe aggregate submission, review SLA, export, retention, vector, and delayed-credit rollout signals.
- Require active tenant access grants for the exact tenant/principal/role combinations being tested. With `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_TENANT_ACCESS_GRANTS=true`, submission, contributor status, reviewer/audit reads, review mutations, dataset/export paths, non-revocation worker mutations, maintenance, and admin ledger/observability reads fail closed without matching grants.
- Run `POST /v1/admin/maintenance` with `dry_run: true`, `reconcile_db_mirror: true`, and `verify_audit_chain: true`. If `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_RECONCILIATION_CLEAN=true` is enabled, requests that omit `reconcile_db_mirror` are expected to fail closed.
- Treat any `blocking_gaps`, object-ref readability/hash failures, key-ref mismatches, projection drift, audit-chain mismatches, RLS readiness failures, signed-claim failures, or unexpected worker skips as promotion blockers.

Per-tenant rollout:

- Promote one tenant and one surface family at a time. Prefer the tenant allowlist flags for DB contributor, reviewer, replay export, audit, tenant-policy, object-ref-required, and object-primary gates before enabling global flags.
- Read cutover order should be DB reader flags first, then object-ref-required modes, then object-primary submit/review, replay export, and derived export modes. Keep file-backed reads available for the rollback window.
- Each promoted tenant needs a smoke pass for submit/status, contributor credit/events, reviewer queue/list/review mutation with required reasons, replay export selection, audit reads, tenant access grant enforcement, and one negative cross-tenant same-id read.
- Keep a fallback tenant on file-backed behavior during the canary so operator smoke checks prove rollout gates are actually scoped.

Rollback:

- Roll back with flags and allowlists first: disable the tenant's DB read, object-ref-required, object-primary, vector, export, or retention-delete gates and leave DB/object dual-write evidence intact.
- Do not delete DB rows, audit events, revocation tombstones, retention job/items, export manifests, or physical-delete receipts as part of rollback. They are evidence and replay inputs.
- If object-primary reads fail, pause the affected surface, inspect object-ref readability/hash/key-ref diagnostics, and fall back to file-backed reads where compatibility still exists.
- If retention deletion misfires, stop retention/revocation workers, preserve tombstones/audit rows, and restore from object versioning where available rather than rewriting history.

Key rotation:

- Rotate upload-claim issuer keys through managed EdDSA/Ed25519 keysets with `kid` selection. Publish the new key, wait for guarded refresh to report healthy safe counts, then begin issuing claims with the new `kid`.
- Keep the previous key active through the maximum accepted claim lifetime plus the issuer-keyset refresh and max-stale window. Remove it only after old-`kid` claims have aged out.
- Production-gated paths should use managed EdDSA/Ed25519 claims. Static tokens and HS256 claims remain bridge credentials and should not be part of the production rotation drill.
- A missing, inactive, unmanaged, or stale `kid` should fail closed; use that as a smoke check before broadening a rotation.

Object-store migration:

- The implemented service-owned object backend is `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_STORE=local_service`. It is suitable for object-primary canaries and verifies tenant storage refs, encryption key refs, decryptability, and object hashes.
- `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_STORE=remote_service` currently parses provider, bucket, KMS key, and credential refs but deliberately fails closed behind the disabled `trace_commons_service_owned_remote_disabled` provider. It is a configuration scaffold, not a remote object-store implementation.
- Do not promote remote object storage until a real provider, migration manifest, object versioning/restore story, payload delete receipts, and rollback drill exist. Existing migration tooling is still a local-service bridge, and `remote_service` payload deletes are unsupported future work.
- For local object-primary canaries, smoke submit/review envelope reads, replay export body reads, benchmark/ranker source object-ref validation, and revocation/retention object deletion for submitted/review, vector, benchmark, and ranker payload refs against exact tenant/object/hash/key-ref matches.

Retention purge dry runs:

- Run retention as dry-run first through `/v1/admin/maintenance` or `/v1/workers/retention-maintenance`, with an explicit purpose, legal-hold policies configured, and DB reconciliation/audit-chain verification enabled from the admin route when promotion evidence is needed.
- Inspect retention job and item rows through `/v1/admin/retention/jobs` and `/v1/admin/retention/jobs/{retention_job_id}/items` before destructive purge. Dry runs should not mark records purged or delete object files.
- Destructive purge should remain tenant-scoped, resumable, and reversible where object versioning exists. It should not start while reconciliation or audit-chain checks are red.

Audit-chain verification:

- Use maintenance `verify_audit_chain: true` for the tenant before enabling DB audit reads or publishing derived/export artifacts from that tenant.
- Require append-order verification for hash-chained file-backed audit rows and DB mirror hash fields where present. Projection drift or stale predecessor rejection is a blocker, not a warning.
- Export smoke checks should verify source-list hashes and that revoked, expired, quarantined, rejected, or out-of-scope sources cannot enter new manifests.

Promotion-gate smoke checks:

- DB reconciliation: `blocking_gaps` is empty, including current retention job/item gaps, credit-ledger gaps, audit-event gaps, reader-projection parity gaps, and object-ref readability/hash/key-ref gaps.
- Tenant access: active grants allow intended operations and revoked/expired/wrong-role grants fail closed without blocking revocation/self-delete, revocation propagation, config-status, tenant-policy admin, or grant-management recovery paths.
- Revocation propagation: a canary source produces tombstone-first invalidation, exact delayed-credit settlement reversal with deterministic negative ledger rows, vector/export invalidation, and service-local submitted/review/vector/benchmark/ranker object deletion only for exact hash-verified targets.
- Object-primary: local-service reads and deletes verify tenant key refs and hashes; unsupported `remote_service` payload deletes and unsupported artifact kinds remain skipped or future work rather than silently succeeding.
- Retention: dry-run counts match the intended tenant slice, legal holds are honored, and destructive purge is not enabled until the dry-run, reconciliation, audit-chain, and rollback evidence has been reviewed.

## Migration and Test Checklist

Implementation checklist for the server-owned storage migration:

- Keep Ironclaw free of TraceDAO server DB/object-store migrations and storage
  backend modules. Completed by pruning the TraceCorpusStore bridge from
  Ironclaw.
- Add the PostgreSQL and libSQL Trace Commons landing schema in
  `zmanian/tracedao-server`. Completed as server repo `V1` schema files.
- Keep `TraceCorpusStore` inside the server crate's DB facade rather than
  Ironclaw's shared `Database` trait. Completed.
- Keep DB writes behind a dark-launch or dual-write flag until parity checks pass. Completed with `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_DUAL_WRITE=true`.
- After parity checks pass, promote critical writes with `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_MIRROR_WRITES=true` so DB mirror failures fail closed instead of creating file-only accepted submissions, credit events, export provenance, or audit/content-read rows.
- Keep DB reads behind surface-specific rollout flags until parity checks pass. Contributor credit/status reads are gated by `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_CONTRIBUTOR_READS=true`, reviewer metadata reads by `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REVIEWER_READS=true`, replay export selection by `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_REPLAY_EXPORT_READS=true`, and audit event reads by `TRACE_COMMONS_DB_AUDIT_READS=true`.
- Keep object payloads in encrypted artifact/object storage; write only object refs and hashes into DB. Completed for the local encrypted artifact sidecar, DB object-ref-backed replay envelope reads, schema-versioned benchmark conversion artifacts with audited registry/evaluation lifecycle updates, source object-ref gating for benchmark/ranker derived exports, object-primary submit/review envelope body storage, and object-primary replay export body reads; remote service-owned object storage and broader object-primary read surfaces remain future work.
- Propagate revocation and retention expiration to DB metadata before DB-first reads. Completed for submission status, tombstones, reasoned privileged revocation audit rows, object-ref invalidation, derived-record invalidation, vector-entry invalidation, replay export manifest/item invalidation, file-backed benchmark/ranker provenance invalidation, exact delayed-credit settlement reversal, contributor credit/status reads, reviewer metadata reads, maintenance repair of already file-marked revoked submissions, retention-expired submission/object/derived/export invalidation, audit events for invalidation counts, and durable retention job/item ledger rows for maintenance runs.
- Add a backfill tool that reads the file-backed tenant directories, validates envelopes, recomputes redaction and summary hashes, writes metadata, and emits audit import events. Initial maintenance-triggered DB mirror backfill exists for already-derived file-backed submissions and now isolates per-item failures with bounded reporting; full recompute/import manifests remain future work.
- Add a reconciliation command that compares file-backed responses with DB-backed metadata for status, review queues, credit, analytics, replay export, object refs, and tombstones. Maintenance reconciliation now covers metadata counts, invalid-source derived/export diagnostics, active object-ref readability/hash/key-ref mismatch diagnostics, reader-projection parity for contributor, reviewer metadata, analytics, audit, and replay/export manifest surfaces, and compact `blocking_gaps`; `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_DB_RECONCILIATION_CLEAN=true` can require reconciliation and make remaining gaps fail closed during production promotion. Remaining work is PostgreSQL breadth, remote object storage, and broader object-primary reads.

Test checklist for the same branch:

- PostgreSQL migration test applies all migrations on an empty database and on a pre-Trace-Commons database.
- libSQL migration test applies `SCHEMA` plus `INCREMENTAL_MIGRATIONS` on an empty in-memory database and on a database initialized before the Trace Commons migration.
- Backend parity tests insert the same logical submission, object ref, audit event, credit event, derived record, vector entry, export manifest, export manifest item, and tombstone through the shared store trait for both backends. libSQL coverage exists; PostgreSQL integration coverage still needs an available test database.
- Tenant-isolation tests seed duplicate `submission_id`, `trace_id`, `canonical_summary_hash`, and contributor pseudonym under two tenants and prove all public store methods filter by tenant. Implemented for the libSQL store contract, PostgreSQL store facade, and ingest DB mirror path, including rejection coverage for export manifest items and derived records that try to link cross-tenant object, derived, or vector refs.
- Handler-level tests drive the future ingest/review/revoke/export callers, not only helper predicates, and assert each mocked DB/object/vector call receives `tenant_id`, `actor_principal_ref`, and `submission_id`. Implemented for submit/review/credit/revoke dual-write, DB-backed export selection, and maintenance-triggered vector metadata indexing.
- Revocation and retention propagation tests prove tombstone-first ordering and invalidation of submissions, derived rows, vectors, benchmark artifacts, exports, and credit settlement. Current coverage verifies DB tombstone/status plus object-ref, derived-row, vector-entry, replay export manifest/item invalidation, exact delayed-credit settlement reversal for newly discovered and already file-marked revocations, service-local submitted/review/vector/benchmark/ranker object-payload deletion, and retention-expired DB submission/object/derived/export invalidation; broader benchmark settlement tests remain future work.
- Retention tests run dry-run, policy-change, legal-hold, retry, and resumed-job paths before any destructive object/vector deletion path is enabled.
- Export tests prove revoked, quarantined, rejected, expired, and out-of-scope submissions cannot enter new manifests, and existing manifests are invalidated after source revocation.
- Security tests verify PostgreSQL RLS with `tracedao.trace_tenant_id` and libSQL query scoping with same ids across tenants.
- Migration rollback tests prove DB-first reads can be disabled without deleting rows and that audit/tombstone rows remain append-only.

## Rollback

Rollback should be operational, not destructive:

- Keep file-backed serving path available until DB-first reads have passed verification.
- During dual-write, mark DB rows with `write_source = file_bridge` or equivalent migration metadata so they can be ignored by rollback readers.
- If object storage fails, continue accepting to file-backed storage for pilot tenants and pause DB object refs with a visible audit event.
- If DB writes fail during dual-write, accept only when the tenant is still configured for MVP mode; production tenants should fail closed after the cutover gate.
- If vector indexing misbehaves, delete or invalidate vector entries and recompute novelty from relational/hash prechecks. Do not roll back submissions.
- If retention deletion misfires, stop workers, restore from object versioning where available, and keep tombstones/audit events. Never delete audit events to hide rollback.

## Retention Safety

Retention must be centrally controlled. The envelope `trace_card.retention_policy` is an input to policy selection, not an executable instruction.

Before deleting content, a retention worker must:

- Re-read the submission through tenant policy.
- Confirm consent scope, allowed use, status, legal hold, and export membership.
- Write or confirm a tombstone.
- Invalidate derived rows, vectors, benchmark artifacts, and exports.
- Emit audit events for planned and completed actions.
- Verify object/vector deletion or mark the item failed for retry.

Use dry runs, sampled manual review, object versioning, delayed hard deletes, and per-tenant kill switches. Retention jobs should be idempotent and resumable.

## Tenant Row Policy

The trusted tenant id comes from authentication. Production request handling should bind a `TenantCtx` or ingest equivalent before any store call.

PostgreSQL policy model:

- Enable row-level security on all `trace_*` tables except global policy dictionaries.
- Set a transaction-local tenant setting such as `tracedao.trace_tenant_id` after authentication.
- Add `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('tracedao.trace_tenant_id', true))` and matching `WITH CHECK` policies for tenant rows.
- Give service-worker roles narrow policies for only their job type.
- Keep admin cross-tenant access behind explicit system-scope methods that always emit audit events.

libSQL policy model:

- No implicit RLS. Every repository method takes `tenant_id` and includes it in predicates.
- Avoid generic "get by id" helpers for tenant-scoped tables.
- Integration tests must seed same UUIDs across two tenants and prove cross-tenant reads, writes, review decisions, revocations, exports, and credit queries cannot cross the tenant boundary.

## Test Plan

Tenant isolation tests:

- Contributor token for tenant A cannot list, status-check, revoke, review, export, or credit-sync tenant B submissions, even when it knows `submission_id`.
- Reviewer/admin token for tenant A cannot access tenant B quarantine, analytics, audit, object refs, vectors, exports, or credit ledger rows.
- Same `submission_id`, `trace_id`, `canonical_summary_hash`, and contributor pseudonym can exist in two tenants without collisions.
- DB-backed queries include tenant predicates at the caller level, not just in low-level helpers.
- PostgreSQL RLS tests run with `tracedao.trace_tenant_id` set to tenant A and confirm tenant B rows are invisible.
- libSQL integration tests use a shared database with two tenants and assert every public repository method scopes by tenant.

Revocation propagation tests:

- Revocation is idempotent and preserves the first revocation timestamp/reason while appending later audit context.
- Revocation writes a tombstone before content invalidation.
- After revocation, status sync reports revoked, review approval fails, credit finalizes or reverses according to policy, and dataset export excludes the source.
- Vector worker checks revocation before read and before publish; a revoked source cannot create or keep an active vector entry.
- Benchmark conversion and export jobs fail closed when revocation occurs between selection and publish.
- Existing replay export manifests and their item rows are marked invalid when a source is revoked after export.
- Retention jobs skip or alter actions when revocation or legal hold state changes after dry-run selection.
- Reconciliation finds active derived artifacts, vectors, benchmark artifacts, or exports whose source is revoked and invalidates them.

Caller-level regression tests should drive the actual handlers or store facades that perform side effects, not only helper predicates. Mocks of DB/object/vector APIs must capture tenant id, actor principal, object ref id, and submission id for every call so missing propagation is visible.

## Implementation Notes

When this plan becomes code:

- Add shared DB trait methods before backend-specific implementations.
- Implement PostgreSQL and libSQL migrations together.
- Keep all new writes behind feature flags until dual-write verification exists.
- Update `FEATURE_PARITY.md` only if user-visible Trace Commons status changes.
- Update `docs/internal/trace-commons.md` if endpoint behavior, threat model, or MVP caveats change.
- Run targeted tests for changed storage, web handlers, migration tooling, and the Rust storage contract.
