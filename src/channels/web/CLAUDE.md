### Extensions
| Method | Path | Description |

Extension lifecycle note:
- Web install, activate, and OAuth callback flows should route through `ExtensionManager::ensure_extension_ready(...)` rather than sequencing `auth()` and `activate()` independently in handlers.
- Preserve the existing `ActionResponse` wire shape, but derive it from `EnsureReadyOutcome` so browser UX stays stable while lifecycle control remains kernel-owned.

### Routines

| DELETE | `/api/routines/{id}` | Delete a routine |
| GET | `/api/routines/{id}/runs` | List runs for a specific routine |

### Trace Contributions
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/traces/policy` | Get the authenticated user's trace contribution policy |
| PUT | `/api/traces/policy` | Update the authenticated user's opt-in policy |
| POST | `/api/traces/preview` | Build a locally redacted contribution envelope from owned thread history |

| GET | `/api/traces/submissions` | List local trace submission records |
| POST | `/api/traces/submissions/{submission_id}/revoke` | Mark a contribution revoked and optionally call the private revocation API |

The static UI exposes these through Settings → Trace Commons for standing opt-in/credit/revocation and through the chat composer Trace button for per-thread redacted preview and queueing. That settings tab also includes an internal reviewer/operator panel that calls a user-configured private ingestion service directly from the browser with a pasted reviewer/admin bearer token. The token is intentionally session-only and is not persisted by the static UI.

Client-local Trace Commons handlers should route redaction, queue writes, queue flushes, status sync, and local record reads through `crate::trace_client::TraceClientHost`. The operator panel remains API-mediated through the configured private TraceDAO service and must not reintroduce server-side storage/control-plane code into the web gateway.

Private ingestion service routes used by the operator panel:
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Ingest service health |
| GET | `/v1/analytics/summary` | Reviewer/admin tenant analytics |
| GET | `/v1/traces` | Reviewer/admin trace metadata list with status, risk, tool, coverage, and limit filters |
| POST | `/v1/traces/{submission_id}/revoke` | Mark a central trace revoked when the ingest service supports propagation |
| GET | `/v1/review/quarantine` | Reviewer/admin quarantine queue |
| GET | `/v1/review/active-learning` | Reviewer/admin active-learning review queue |
| POST | `/v1/review/{submission_id}/decision` | Approve/reject quarantined trace |
| POST | `/v1/review/leases/claim-next` | Claim the next prioritized available DB-backed review lease |
| POST | `/v1/review/leases/claim-batch` | Claim a bounded batch of prioritized available DB-backed review leases |
| POST/DELETE | `/v1/review/{submission_id}/lease` | Claim or release a DB-backed review lease |
| POST | `/v1/review/{submission_id}/credit-events` | Append delayed credit event |
| GET | `/v1/datasets/replay` | Export approved replay dataset slice |
| GET | `/v1/datasets/replay/manifests` | List replay export manifest metadata |
| POST | `/v1/benchmarks/convert` | Convert approved replayable traces into benchmark candidates |
| GET | `/v1/ranker/training-candidates` | Export approved ranker training candidates |
| GET | `/v1/ranker/training-pairs` | Export approved ranker training pairs |
| GET | `/v1/admin/retention/jobs` | Admin-only DB-backed retention maintenance job ledger |
| GET | `/v1/admin/retention/jobs/{retention_job_id}/items` | Admin-only per-submission retention job actions |
| GET | `/v1/admin/operational-summary` | Admin-only aggregate operational counts for submissions, review SLA, exports, retention, vectors, and delayed credit |
| POST | `/v1/admin/maintenance` | Run tenant-scoped revocation propagation and export-cache maintenance |
| GET | `/v1/audit/events` | List tenant audit events when available |

The operator panel must keep calls API-mediated through the configured private ingestion service and degrade cleanly on `404`/`501` for older deployments that do not yet expose the newer operator endpoints.
The panel includes read-only config status, replay manifest, and retention ledger actions for `/v1/admin/config-status`, `/v1/datasets/replay/manifests`, `/v1/admin/retention/jobs`, and `/v1/admin/retention/jobs/{retention_job_id}/items`; it uses the session-only admin token and never persists the retention job id or bearer credential.
Reviewer queues accept `lease_filter=all|mine|available|active|expired` for assignment-aware triage. Review lease claims POST `{ lease_ttl_seconds?: i64, review_due_at?: RFC3339 DateTime<Utc> }` to `/v1/review/{submission_id}/lease`; claim/release responses include tenant and trace identifiers plus review assignment, lease expiration, and due-at fields for operator confirmation.
Claim-next review leases POST `{ lease_ttl_seconds?: i64, review_due_at?: RFC3339 DateTime<Utc>, privacy_risk?: low|medium|high }` to `/v1/review/leases/claim-next` and return the same lease confirmation shape. Claim-batch adds `{ limit?: usize }` at `/v1/review/leases/claim-batch` and returns aggregate claim counts plus per-lease confirmations. Operational summaries are safe aggregate rollups only: they expose tenant/storage refs and counts by status/state/category, not submission payloads, raw trace content, or per-item identifiers.

## SSE Event Types (`SseEvent` in `types.rs`)

The SSE contract — every field is `#[serde(tag = "type")]`:

| Type | When emitted |
|------|-------------|
| `response` | Final text response from agent |
| `stream_chunk` | Streaming token (partial response) |
| `thinking` | Agent status update during reasoning |
| `tool_started` | Tool call began |
| `tool_completed` | Tool call finished (includes success/error) |
| `tool_result` | Tool output preview |
| `status` | Generic status message |
| `job_started` | Sandbox job created |
| `job_message` | Message from sandbox worker |
| `job_tool_use` | Tool invoked inside sandbox |
| `job_tool_result` | Tool result from sandbox |
| `job_status` | Sandbox job status update |
| `job_result` | Sandbox job final result |
| `gate_required` | Engine v2 gate requires user input (approval/auth/external) |
| `gate_resolved` | Engine v2 gate was resolved |
| `approval_needed` | Legacy approval event |
| `auth_required` | Legacy extension/auth event |
| `auth_completed` | Extension auth flow finished |
| `extension_status` | WASM channel activation status changed |
| `error` | Error from agent or gateway |
| `heartbeat` | SSE keepalive (empty payload) |

**SSE serialization:** Events use `#[serde(tag = "type")]` — the wire format is `{"type":"<variant>", ...fields}`. The SSE frame's `event:` field is set to the same string as `type` for easy `addEventListener` use in the browser.

**SSE event IDs / reconnect:** Chat SSE frames now also include an `id:` field in the form `<boot_uuid>:<counter>`. Browser reconnects can supply the last seen ID either via the standard `Last-Event-ID` header or the `last_event_id` query parameter (used by the web UI because `EventSource` reconnect state is recreated in JavaScript). IDs are process-scoped: after a server restart, old IDs are ignored and the client rebuilds thread history from `/api/chat/history`. **Note:** Event IDs are only available on the SSE `subscribe()` path. `subscribe_raw()` (used by WebSocket and the Responses API) returns `AppEvent` without IDs — WebSocket clients rely on their own reconnect semantics rather than event-ID dedup.

**WebSocket envelope:** Over WebSocket, SSE events are wrapped as `{"type":"event","event_type":"<variant>","data":{...}}`. Ping/pong uses `{"type":"ping"}` / `{"type":"pong"}`. Client-to-server messages (`message`, `approval`, `auth_token`, `auth_cancel`) are defined in `WsClientMessage` in `types.rs`.

**To add a new SSE event:** Use the `add-sse-event` skill (`/add-sse-event`). It scaffolds the Rust variant, serialization, broadcast call, and frontend handler. Also add a matching arm to `WsServerMessage::from_sse_event()` in `types.rs`.

## Auth

All protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN>`. The token is set via `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` env var. Missing/wrong token → 401. The `Bearer` prefix is compared case-insensitively (RFC 6750).

**Query-string token auth (`?token=xxx`):** Because `EventSource` and WebSocket upgrades cannot set custom headers from the browser, three endpoints also accept the token as a URL query parameter: `/api/chat/events`, `/api/logs/events`, and `/api/chat/ws`. All other endpoints reject query-string tokens. If you add a new SSE or WebSocket endpoint, register its path in `allows_query_token_auth()` in `auth.rs`.

**If no `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured**, a random 32-character alphanumeric token is generated at startup and printed to the console.

Rate limiting: chat send endpoints are capped at **30 messages per 60 seconds** (sliding window, not per-IP).

## GatewayState

The shared state struct (`server.rs`) holds refs to all subsystems. Fields are `Option<Arc<T>>` so the gateway can start even when optional subsystems (workspace, sandbox, skills) are disabled. Always null-check before use in handlers.

Key fields:
- `msg_tx` — `RwLock<Option<mpsc::Sender<IncomingMessage>>>` — sends messages to the agent loop; set when `start()` is called on the `Channel`.
- `sse` — `SseManager` — broadcast hub; call `state.sse.broadcast(event)` from any handler.
- `ws_tracker` — `Option<Arc<WsConnectionTracker>>` — tracks WS connection count separately from SSE.
- `chat_rate_limiter` — `RateLimiter` — 30 req/60 s sliding window shared across all chat send callers.
- `scheduler` — `Option<SchedulerSlot>` — used to inject follow-up messages into running agent jobs.
- `cost_guard` — `Option<Arc<CostGuard>>` — exposes token usage / cost totals in the status endpoint.
- `startup_time` — `Instant` — used to compute uptime in the gateway status response.
- `registry_entries` — `Vec<RegistryEntry>` — loaded once at startup from registry manifests; used by the available extensions API without hitting the network.

Subsystems are wired via `with_*` builder methods on `GatewayChannel` (`mod.rs`). Each call rebuilds `Arc<GatewayState>` — safe to call before `start()`, not after.

## SSE / WebSocket Connection Limits

Both SSE and WebSocket share the same `SseManager` broadcast channel. Key characteristics:

- **Broadcast buffer:** 256 events. A slow client that falls behind will miss events — the `BroadcastStream` silently drops lagged events. SSE clients are expected to reconnect and re-fetch history.
- **Max connections:** `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS` (default `100`) total across SSE + WebSocket. Connections beyond the limit receive a 503 / are immediately dropped.
- **SSE keepalive:** Axum's `KeepAlive` sends an empty event every **30 seconds** to prevent proxy timeouts.
- **WebSocket:** Two tasks per connection — a sender task (broadcast → WS frames) and a receiver loop (WS frames → agent). When the client disconnects, the sender is aborted and both the SSE connection counter and WS tracker counter are decremented.

## CORS and Security Headers

CORS is restricted to the gateway's own origin (same IP+port and `localhost`+port). Allowed methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Allowed headers: `Content-Type`, `Authorization`. Credentials are allowed.

All responses include:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

**Request body limit:** 10 MB (`DefaultBodyLimit::max(10 * 1024 * 1024)`), sized for image uploads (#725). Larger payloads return 413.

## Pending Gates

Classic agent approvals are in-memory, but engine v2 pauses live in the unified pending-gate store with file-backed recovery under `~/.ironclaw/pending-gates.json`. `HistoryResponse.pending_gate` rehydrates from that store so cards survive thread switches, SSE reconnects, and process restarts. Gate UI must remain thread-scoped: stale cards from another thread should not be rendered or resolved in the current thread.

## Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Define request/response types in `types.rs`.
2. Implement the handler in the appropriate `handlers/*.rs` file (or inline in `server.rs` for simple handlers).
3. Register the route in `start_server()` in `server.rs` under the correct router (`public`, `protected`, or `statics`).
4. If it is an SSE or WebSocket endpoint, add its path to `allows_query_token_auth()` in `auth.rs`.
5. If it requires a new `GatewayState` field, add it to the struct and to both the `GatewayChannel::new()` initializer and `rebuild_state()` in `mod.rs`, then add a `with_*` builder method.
